title: "About Galaxy"

**Galaxy is an open ecosystem for data integration and analysis.**

The *Galaxy Ecosystem* consists of **software, platforms,** and **community**:

* Galaxy **software** aims to empower researchers to run, save, share, and repeat their own data analyses.
* Galaxy **platforms** are Galaxy deployments that provide access to Galaxy.
* Galaxy is a global **community** that values and enables *accessible, reproducible,* and	*transparent* computational research.

# Galaxy Software

Galaxy is a coordinated suite of software components.  At its core is the *Galaxy server*.  This component powers Galaxy platforms and provides a graphical user interface. The server code supports importing data, and running tools and pipelines to integrate, analyze, and visualize data. The server software also coordinates authentication, manages users, tracks every step of every analysis, and supports sharing and publishing of analyses and reusable workflows.

A constellation of other software components and services also support:

* programmatic access to Galaxy, so that anything you can do with the GUI can also be done programmatically
* an extensive library of training materials for learning Galaxy, and for helping your community learn Galaxy.
* defining, testing, and publishing tools in the Galaxy framework
* deploying, maintaining and dynamically scaling your own Galaxy server 
* distributing analysis, authentication, and storage across any infrastructure that you have access to

*Everything* Galaxy does is open source.


# Galaxy Platforms

Galaxy is deployed on everything from laptops to distributed high-performance computing and cloud systems. These are used by single users, individual labs or institutions, research networks, or made available to the public.

There are numerous *publicly accessible* Galaxy servers, in many domains, and that *anyone* can use.  There are also pre-configured Galaxy *images* that can be deployed in minutes, on your laptop (using Docker) or on public cloud services.  If you want to use Galaxy *right now* then there are 150+ options for doing so with little or no configuration.  If you your own public or internal institutional server, Galaxy offers extensive support and training for creating production grade Galaxy instances.

We estimate that there are thousands of installed Galaxy instances around the world.

# Galaxy Community

*Everything* in the Galaxy Ecosystem is supported by the Galaxy community: code, tool definition, support (user and admin), documentation, training, outreach, testing, events, and more.  We communicate over chat, email, GitHub, and at numerous in-person and online events, including the annual international Galaxy Community Conference.

Galaxy also has many regional and domain-specific communities that serve the needs of these communities.  

# Learn

There are a wealth of resources for learning and deploying Galaxy to further your (and your community's) research.

* Using Galaxy
  * How to use Galaxy for my data analsyis
  * Which Galaxy platform to use for my data analysis
  * Find supporting information, and get help

* Running my own Galaxy server
  * Deployment platform options from your own laptop to institutional HPC to public clouds
  * How to configure, deploy and manage your own server

# Join

Galaxy is a fully open community and everyone who uses Galaxy *is a community member.* Welcome aboard.

Please **get involved!**   *The Galaxy community values all types of contribution:*  Bug reporting, sharing your analyses, planning an event, presenting training, developing new software components, and everything in between.  The community needs active members on all of our support channels, every day. We also need help wrapping new tools, writing new test cases, and updating documentation.
