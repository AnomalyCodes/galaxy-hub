**Galaxy is an open ecosystem for data integration and analysis.**

The Galaxy Ecosystem is:

* **Software:** Empower researchers to run, save, share, and repeat their own data analyses.
* **Platforms:** Galaxy deployments that provide access to Galaxy.
* **Community:** A global community that supports *accessible, reproducible,* and *transparent* computational research.


# Galaxy Software

Galaxy is a [coordinated suite of software components](/src/about/software/index.md).  At its core is the **Galaxy server**, the software that powers Galaxy instances and provides a graphical user interface. Galaxy server code supports running tools and pipelines to integrate, analyze, and visualize data. The server also coordinates authentication, manages users, tracks every step of every analysis, and supports sharing and publishing of analyses and reusable workflows.

Other software components and services surround the core software and support: programmatic access to Galaxy; tool definition and publishing; server deployment, dynamic scalability, and maintenance; and distributed storage and analysis.

All [Galaxy software](/src/about/software/index.mc) is open source.

# Galaxy Platforms

Galaxy is deployed on everything from laptops to distributed high-performance computing and cloud systems. There are numerous

* *publicly accessible* Galaxy servers that *anyone* can use.
* *pre-configured Galaxy images* that can be deployed in minutes, on your laptop (using Docker) or on public cloud services.
* *lab, department, institutional, and consortium servers* that are accessible within an organization.

There are over 150 options for using Galaxy right now, with zero or little configuration.  Want your own server? Galaxy offers extensive support and training for creating production grade Galaxy instances in your organization.

# Galaxy Community

*Everything* in the Galaxy Ecosystem is supported by the Galaxy community: code, tools, support (user and admin), documentation, training, outreach, testing, events, and more.  We communicate over chat, email, GitHub, and at numerous in-person and online events, including the annual international Galaxy Community Conference.  Galaxy also has many regional and domain-specific communities.
